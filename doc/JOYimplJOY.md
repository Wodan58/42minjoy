42minjoy
========

This small version of Joy is claimed to be almost free of bugs.

Even so, there can be some surprises.

The reason for maintaining this version of Joy is that it is an order of
magnitude smaller than the full version.

And it has some features that are not present in full Joy, such as scantime
expression evaluation.
